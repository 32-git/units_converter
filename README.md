# units_converter

A place to convert frequently used units from all the main fields of measurement.

Always open to improvement in form of new fields and especially new units. 

--> In the case of a unit suggestion, please provide the unit name, symbol and ***exact*** conversion formulas to each of the other units.

--> In the case of a field suggestion, please state its name and some units to consider in that field.

Plans for the project:
  - [ ] units.py
