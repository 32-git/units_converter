# units_converter

A place to convert frequently used units from all the main fields of measurement.

Always open to improvement in form of new fields and especially new units. 

--> In the case of a unit suggestion, please provide the unit name, symbol and ***exact*** conversion formulas to each of the other units.

--> In the case of a field suggestion, please state its name and some units to consider in that field.

Plans for the project:

    - [ ] Area (units + conversions)
    - [ ] Volume (units + conversions)
    - [ ] Mass (units + conversions)
    - [x] ~~Temperature (units + conversions)~~

  - [ ] converter.py
    - [ ] Back to menu button { (command: clear frame, menu()) }
    - [ ] Swap units button { command: units_left.set(units_right.get()) }
    - [ ] Tip/Formula at the bottom with LaTex display?
